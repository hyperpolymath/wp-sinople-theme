= Sinople WordPress Theme

A modern, semantically-aware WordPress theme powered by *ReScript*, *Deno*, and *WASM*. Sinople (from the heraldic term for green) combines traditional WordPress theming with cutting-edge semantic web technologies for character relationships, glosses, and knowledge graphs.

== Features

- 🧠 *Semantic Web Processing*: RDF/OWL processing via Rust WASM for construct relationships
- 🌐 *IndieWeb Level 4*: Full Webmention and Micropub support
- ♿ *WCAG 2.3 AAA*: Maximum accessibility compliance
- 🔒 *Type Safety*: ReScript-only architecture (NO TypeScript)
- ⚡ *Performance*: Rust-powered WASM semantic processor
- 🎨 *Modern Stack*: Deno + Fresh framework for server-side rendering
- 🤖 *Theme Transpilation System* (🚧 WIP): Automatically extract and recreate WordPress themes
  - Web scraper with license detection
  - Schema-based transformation (Cue/Nix)
  - Haskell → ReScript transpiler
  - ML-powered learning (LSM + Julia + Logtalk)
  - See [THEME_TRANSPILATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](THEME_TRANSPILATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 7.4+

./build.sh

= Development mode (watch files)
./dev.sh

= Run tests
cd tests
deno test integration/
```
